Formative One - Regex Onboarding Hackathon

The Task

To extract the required data from the hundreds of thousands of pages of string response you get from your API, you have decided to unleash the raw power of Regular Expressions. You already know how the specific types of data you are looking for appear in the string. This is how you have summarized that information, now all you have to do is write your Regular Expressions.  

As a developer, you are tasked to implement at least 4 of the 8 form field validations below:
Email addresses:
user@example.com
firstname.lastname@company.co.uk
URLs:
https://www.example.comLinks to an external site.

2:30 PM (12-hour format)
HTML tags:

<div class="example">
<img src="image.jpg" alt="description">
Hashtags:
#example
#ThisIsAHashtag
Currency amounts:
